# GEO-metadata
A tool to organize the extracted GEO-Metadata into a dataframe

- From the files generated by XML webscraper tool, this tool will organize all the metadata extracted in a dataframe. Furthermore, the extra columns such as Target-interest (standardized names), Categories (Control and IP), Confidence level and SRR_count will be generated.

# Requiremets

```python 3.8``` and ```create a env with requirements.txt```

# Usage

```
usage: main.py [-h] -f FILE -s SRR -d DICT [-w]

A script to organize the GEO metadata scrapped by XML_scraper tool, including SRX, SRR, SRR_Count, GPL and GSE titles.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  The absolute path to the csv file with the metadata information obtained via XML webscraper script
  -s SRR, --srr SRR     The absolute path to the csv file with the metadata SRX address, SRX and SRR information obtained via SRX/SRR
                        XML wevscrapp script
  -d DICT, --dict DICT  The absolute path to the csv file with the target regexs (JF file)
  -w, --webscraper
  ```

# Standardized target column

- If you want to add a new column to the dataframe generated by the script above you can run the main_stand.py (standtarget folder)

```usage: main_stand.py [-h] -f FILE -d DICT -o OUTPUT

A script to generate a standardized Target column from the GEO-Metadata csv file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  The absolute path to the csv file with the metadata information obtained via GEO-Metadata tool
  -d DICT, --dict DICT  The absolute path to the csv file with the target regexs
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The absolute path to save the final GEO dataframe including the Target-GEO column
